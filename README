It's a podcast!  It's a blog!  It's a podblog!

This is the podcast/blog engine that powers the "Minimum Viable" website.  It's
a a typical "Mad Wombat" special, with the following components:

- Rails 3.x
- Jruby
- PostgreSQL
- Mizuno

This means it's incredibly fast.  Really, stupid fast.

Note that we use Amazon's S3 to store the actual podcast data.  You can fill in
your own credentials in config/s3.yml.

NOTE TO DON:  For simplicity's sake, we're using autoincrementing integer IDs rather than UUIDs.  Yes, I know.
